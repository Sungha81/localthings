"""Capabilities for the Samsung ARTIK051_TVTL-class air purifier family
(model AX60R5080WD/SE, issue #56).

Power, kids-lock, remote-control, alarms, and the energy meter are the shared
common.py capabilities (this family exposes the standard /power/0+/power/vs/0
pair and /alarms/vs/0, /energy/consumption/vs/0). /diagnosis/vs/0 reuses
dishwasher.DIAGNOSIS -- identical field/write contract
(x.com.samsung.da.diagnosisStart, 'Ready' on both dumps).

/mode/vs/0's x.com.samsung.da.options array packs multiple independent
'<Prefix>_<value>' flags into one list -- the same packed-list contract
laundry.py's option_value/option_write already model for /course/vs/0's
options[] (reused directly below, just against this family's own href). Per
issue #56's follow-up (five diagnostics dumps captured with the physical unit
set to Auto/Sleep/Low/Medium/High):
  Light_On / Light_Off  -- a plain on/off flag; MODE below models it as a
                            real switch, RMW-replacing just that one entry.
                            NOT the same polarity as the AC family's own
                            Light_On/Light_Off token on its own /mode/vs/0
                            (airconditioner._display_light_on) -- that one is
                            confirmed inverted (Light_Off means the panel is
                            lit) on live hardware. Same token name, same
                            resource name, different device type and
                            opposite meaning -- don't unify them.
  Comode_Off            -- read 'Off' on *every* one of the five dumps,
                            including High/Low/Medium/Auto -- confirms this
                            is NOT the fan-speed selector (ruling out the
                            original guess); exposed read-only since its
                            actual purpose is still unconfirmed.
  OptionCode_60282       -- confirmed opaque/not user-facing in the
                            SmartThings app; not modeled (same treatment as
                            range_hood's OptionCode_* token on the same
                            href).
  Blooming_*             -- confirmed to have no corresponding SmartThings
                            app setting; dropped entirely rather than kept
                            as an unexplained diagnostic (it did track 1:1
                            with Sleep mode across the five dumps -- 0 in
                            Sleep, 6 otherwise -- so it's plausibly an
                            automatic side effect of sleep mode, e.g. a
                            display-dimming level, but that's still a guess).

/airflow/0's `speed` is a real fan-speed control (issue #56 follow-up). The
first round of five dumps above wasn't conclusive -- it read 0 for both
Auto *and* High, and 3 for Low/Medium *and* Sleep, likely because all five
were captured within about a minute of each other, faster than this
integration's own ~30s poll cycle could settle each change. A later,
properly-spaced capture (power confirmed on, sensor values actively
changing, one setting changed at a time, several minutes apart) resolved a
clean mapping instead -- and additionally surfaced a sixth value this
board's app exposes that the original round never tried:

    0 = Auto, 1 = Sleep, 2 = Low, 3 = Medium, 4 = High, 6 = WindFree
    (5 does not occur -- this model has no Turbo mode)

This is NOT a linear intensity scale -- WindFree (6) is a diffuse
gentle-air mode, not "stronger than High" (4) -- so AIRFLOW_GENERIC below
exposes it as a named preset (fan.py's LocalThingsAirflowFan) rather than
an ordered percentage. LEVEL_TO_PRESET is a hardcoded table, not read live
from the device, because this href/field has no accompanying supportedModes
(or similarly-shaped) list to hang names off of -- unlike the TP1X/
A-VTWW-TP2-21 families' FAN/WIND_STRENGTH_FAN below, which do.

/airflow/vs/0's vendor `speedLevel` mirrors the same numeric codes as
`speed` above on every dump seen (matching values on both hrefs at High and
at WindFree), but is NOT used as the write target -- AIRFLOW_VS_FALLBACK
stays a read-only diagnostic since /airflow/0 already has a confirmed,
reliable write contract and there's no reason to prefer the vendor
duplicate.
