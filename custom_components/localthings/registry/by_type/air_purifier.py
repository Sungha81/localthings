"""Air-purifier device registry.

Spans three board generations sharing this one registry (see
capabilities/air_purifier.py's module docstring for the per-href
match_fn discriminators that keep them from colliding):

- ARTIK051_TVTL-class (issue #56). Resolved via the 'TVTL' modelNum board
  token (see by_type/__init__.py). Power is bound via
  capabilities/air_purifier_power.py's board-scoped pair instead of
  *common.POWER -- confirmed on this board that /power/vs/0 leads /power/0
  by several seconds in both directions, the opposite of common.py's
  generic-first default. That module's *_OTHER capabilities keep every
  other board generation below on common.py's original, unmodified
  priority; see its docstring for the full reasoning.
- TP1X_DA-AC-AIR-class (issue #130). Resolved via the 'AIR' board token.
  Adds real fan-mode control plus
  display/HEPA-filter/pet-filter/sound resources the older family never
  reported; reuses airconditioner.DISPLAY_LIGHT and airconditioner.MUTE_ONCE
  for /light/vs/0 and /option/muteonce/vs/0, which are identical shapes on
  the shared DA-AC- board family.
- A-VTWW-TP2-21-COMMON-class (issue #151). Resolved via the 'VTWW' board
  token, added for it. Its fan
  is WIND_STRENGTH_FAN on /wind/strength/vs/0 rather than FAN on
  /mode/vs/0 -- see that capability's comment.

Reuses dishwasher.DIAGNOSIS for /diagnosis/vs/0 (identical field/write
contract).
